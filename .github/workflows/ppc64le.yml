  # Emulation on ppc64le platform is incredibly slow and memory demanding.
  # It seems that any executable with GHC RTS takes at least 7-8 Gb of RAM, so we can
  # run `cabal` or `ghc` on their own, but cannot run them both at the same time, striking
  # out `cabal test`. Instead we unpack packages and invoke `ghc --make` manually, and
  # even so `ghc -O` is prohibitively expensive. This is indeed a fragile and hacky workflow,
  # but it allows us to test a 64-but platform without vectorised instructions.
